Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities. But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible. To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy. Hugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.

The next step is to use the Access Token to get the content of the IG post. First we need to have the URL of the IG post, click the dot in the top right corner of the post, and click the 「Copy link」to get the URL OF THE POST: With a post URL and a Token, we can use a GET to GET information about the post: const getToken = 'Web address obtained after deployment' ; const igUri = 'Website of IG post' ; const hideCaption = true ; //Wheather to hide the description,true to hide,false to not hide fetch ( getToken ) . then ( response =\u003e response . json ( ) ) . then ( response =\u003e response . access_token ) . then ( token =\u003e { fetch ( `https://graph.facebook.com/v9.0/instagram_oembed?url= ${ igUri }\u0026access_token= ${ token }\u0026hidecaption= ${ hideCaption }` ) . then ( response =\u003e response . json ( ) ) . then ( response =\u003e { console . log ( response ) ; } ) } ) ; As you can see from the API URL, the required parameters are: Ig post address, Access Token, and hidecaption to hide the description. hidecaption isn’t in the new file, but magically it is in the old one, which Augustus tried out after reading the previous article, so it’s no surprise that FB will take it out one day.

In addition to the above three parameters, there are two other parameters are provided in the official file: maxwidth, omitscript. maxwidth is the maximum width you can specify when embedding a post. omitscriptis a Boolean value, and the default value is false. Generally speaking, when we embed IG posts, IG will automatically load the post data. If we want to have the need to load additional posts, we can write true here, and then execute instgrm.Embeds.process() to load the posts into the page. But! During the implementation, it is not sure whether Augustus is wrongly written. No matter whether omitscript is trueor false, if instgrm. Embeds. Process() ‘is not executed, the post will appear white, like this: And the old methods spit out html, which itself refers to IG’s embedd.html.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

Note\r\rThis article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extented Markdown syntax of CodeIT theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. \r\r Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!
